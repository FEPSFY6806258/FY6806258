        In this paper I am going to discuss how nuclear waste occurs, the dangers of it as well as the measures we take to remove it. Nuclear waste is split into 3
        categories, high, intermediate and low. The main problem is the high level waste as that holds the majority of the radioactivity. Nuclear waste happens
        after a process called nuclear fission occurs where we have an unstable Uranium - 235 and let a neutron pass it causing it to split and for the energy to
        be released and for us to use it (we use the energy for electricity and heating). In summary the dangers of nuclear waste are that they can cause cancer 
        just like any other radiation. They kill cells and cause cells to mutate which can lead to cancer. The nuclear waste can also kill almost immediately if 
        the intensity of the radiation is high enough. We take several measures to ensure that we do not deal with the radioactivity of the nuclear waste such as
        storing them in special containers.

        Nuclear waste can be broken into 3 different categories, high-level waste, intermediate level waste and low level waste. The high level waste is spent fuel
        containing 95% of the radioactivity, the intermediate level waste only contains 4% of radioactivity and these can be things such as used filters or steel
        components within the reactor. The low level waste are lightly contaminated items which only hold 1% of radioactivity from the nuclear waste. 
        (What is nuclear waste and what do we do with it? - World Nuclear Association.). We will be mainly focusing on the high level waste as that is where most of
        the danger lies.

         Nuclear waste is brought upon after nuclear fission occurs, sustained fission is initiated when a fissile material absorbs a neutron, splits into fission 
        products and 3 - 4 neutrons (Taylor, Hydrogen and its detection in fusion and fission nuclear materials – a review 2022). The fission products are what the
        nuclear waste is. Once the Uranium - 235 absorbs the neutron, it quickly breaks into 2 parts (MIT Nuclear Reactor Laboratory). The products of nuclear fission 
        is what high level nuclear waste is and contains loads of energy from the reaction between the Uranium - 235 and the neutron and is unstable and will release
        its energy from the time the reaction happened and into thousands of years into the future.

       The dangers of nuclear waste is it is radioactive and exposure to this type of radioactivity can kill human cells or damage them in a way that causes DNA
        mutations which can lead to cancer, as well as intense exposure being able to lead to fairly instant death (Ravenhall, Everything you need to know about 
        nuclear waste 2019). A recent example of this is the Chernobyl incident where a nuclear power plant malfunctioned and caused an explosion and fire which 
        led to large amounts of radiation being put out to the atmosphere endangering the workers and everyone around there as well as the wildlife. ‘According to 
        the official, internationally recognised death toll, just 31 people died as an immediate result of Chernobyl’ (Gray, The long shadow cast by Chernobyl 2022).
        It was also predicted that a further 4000 people might die as a result of the radiation exposure which shows how dangerous nuclear waste and energy can be if
        not handled properly.

       The high level waste is turned into a solid form in a process called ‘vitrification’. This is when the liquid waste is mixed with crushed glass in a furnace to
        make a molten product. The molten product is then poured into a stainless steel canister. The canisters are then placed into an air cooled store. They are then
        left there for a minimum of fifty years to cool and let the radioactivity to decay away. After the radioactivity has decreased and the canister has cooled down
        the canister is then moved for the next process to take place which is ‘geological disposal’. This involves placing the packaged nuclear waste underground where
        the rock does not allow the radioactivity to escape back into the environment. There is no plan to go back for this waste and it is than left here (UK Radioactive Waste Inventory).
